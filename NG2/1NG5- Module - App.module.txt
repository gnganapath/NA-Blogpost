NG5- Module - App.module.ts
============================

Angular apps are modular and Angular has its own modularity system called NgModules. NgModules are a big deal.
Every Angular app has at least one NgModule class, the root module, conventionally named AppModule.
While the root module may be the only module in a small application, most apps have many more feature modules, each a cohesive block of code dedicated to an application domain, a workflow, or a closely related set of capabilities.

An NgModule, whether a root or feature, is a class with an @NgModule decorato
NgModule is a decorator function that takes a single metadata object whose properties describe the module. The most important properties are:

declarations - the view classes that belong to this module. Angular has three kinds of view classes: components, directives, and pipes.

exports - the subset of declarations that should be visible and usable in the component templates of other modules.

imports - other modules whose exported classes are needed by component templates declared in this module.

providers - creators of services that this module contributes to the global collection of services; they become accessible in all parts of the app.

bootstrap - the main application view, called the root component, that hosts all other app views. Only the root module should set this bootstrap property

generic.app.module.ts
---------------------

import { NgModule }      from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
@NgModule({
  imports:      [ BrowserModule ],
  providers:    [ Logger ],
  declarations: [ AppComponent ],
  exports:      [ AppComponent ],
  bootstrap:    [ AppComponent ]
})
export class AppModule { }


Sample Ng-cli app.module at initial level
--------------------------------------------

import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
// import { routing } from './app.routing.ts';  =>  App routing file needs to include 
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';


@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [		// import Angular's modules ->BrowserModule,    HttpModule,    RouterModule,    FormsModule,    ReactiveFormsModule, <= coresponding import statement as to add 
	BrowserModule   
  ],
  providers: [],   // expose our Services and Providers into Angular's dependency injection  Mostly service files <= coresponding import statement as to add 
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
